# GitOps Multi-Cluster Management Challenge



Welcome to the advanced DevOps recruitment challenge! This task will test your skills in GitOps practices, multi-cluster management, and Helm chart usage.



## Objective



Create a readable and maintainable GitOps repository that can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across different stages (e.g., development, staging, production) using a single branch strategy.



## Requirements



1. Use either Flux or Argo CD as your GitOps tool.

2. Implement a single branch strategy for managing all clusters.

3. Utilize Helm charts for application deployments.

4. Demonstrate the ability to deploy different configurations to different stages.



## Detailed Tasks



1. **Repository Structure**

   - Create a Git repository with a clear and logical structure for multi-cluster management.

   - Implement a single branch strategy that allows for easy management of all clusters.



2. **Cluster Configurations**

   - Set up configurations for at least three different stages (e.g., dev, staging, prod).

   - Ensure that each stage can have its own specific settings while sharing common configurations.



3. **Helm Chart Usage**

   - Utilize Helm charts for deploying applications.

   - Demonstrate how to use different values for the same chart across different stages.



4. **GitOps Tool Setup**

   - Configure either Flux or Argo CD to work with your repository.

   - Ensure that the tool can correctly apply configurations to the appropriate clusters.



## Evaluation Criteria



- Clarity and maintainability of the repository structure

- Effective use of the chosen GitOps tool (Flux or Argo CD)

- Proper implementation of the single branch strategy

- Correct usage of Helm charts and value overrides for different stages

- Documentation quality and completeness



## Submission Guidelines



- Provide a link to your Git repository containing all the necessary configurations and charts.

- Include a comprehensive README.md with:

  - An overview of your repository structure and the rationale behind it

  - Instructions on how to set up and use your GitOps configuration

  - Explanations of how to add new applications or clusters to the setup

  - Any assumptions or design decisions you made



## Tips



- Consider using Kustomize in conjunction with Helm for even more flexible configurations.

- Implement a clear naming convention for your resources to ensure easy identification across clusters.

- Think about how your solution would scale to handle dozens of clusters and applications.

- Consider security aspects, such as secrets management across different stages.



We look forward to seeing your innovative approach to this GitOps challenge!
